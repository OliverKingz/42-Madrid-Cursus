## About 42 Madrid

42 is a global, innovative coding school that emphasizes self-learning, collaboration, and hands-on project work. There are no teachers, only peers. This educational approach challenges students to develop both hard and soft skills while working on real-world problems in a variety of programming languages and technologies.
