# 42 Madrid Cursus by Oliver Zamora (ozamora-)

Welcome to my 42 Madrid Cursus portfolio! Here you will find an overview of the skills and projects I’ve developed throughout my journey at 42 Madrid, a highly innovative, self-paced programming school that uses a peer-to-peer learning model.

## About 42 Madrid

42 is a global, innovative coding school that emphasizes self-learning, collaboration, and hands-on project work. There are no teachers, only peers. This educational approach challenges students to develop both hard and soft skills while working on real-world problems in a variety of programming languages and technologies.
